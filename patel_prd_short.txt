Product Requirements Document: The Patel Advisory "Digital Facilitator" Platform

Executive Summary:
Patel Advisory is transitioning its "Strategic Assessment & Recommendations" service from a manual, document-heavy process to a streamlined digital workflow. The goal is to build a "Digital Facilitator" platform that standardizes data collection, organizes client information, and facilitates report assembly through structured templates and logic-based workflows.

The platform will serve as:
1. A Lead Magnet: A public-facing "Business Health Pulse" diagnostic tool to capture prospect data using conditional logic.
2. A Data Collection Hub: A centralized system for gathering structured data (via surveys) and unstructured data (via transcripts and file uploads).
3. A Workflow Manager: A project management dashboard to track assessment progress across the 8 specific assessment stages.
4. A Report Assembler: A builder that compiles collected data, manual consultant notes, and tagged transcript snippets into stage summaries and a final master report.

User Personas:
1. The Principal Consultant (Patel - Admin): Expert analyst who needs structured environment to store notes, interview findings, and client documents. Requires "single source of truth" for each client engagement.

2. The Client Champion (CEO/Founder): Primary point of contact who needs visibility into project status and a secure place to share sensitive data.

3. The Client Stakeholder (Employee): Interviewee or survey respondent who needs frictionless, mobile-friendly interface for surveys.

5. People Power - Org, Roles & Succession (Org Chart Review & Interviews)
6. Recommended Key Strategies (Strategy Synthesis)
